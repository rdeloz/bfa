        <h3>What is It?</h3>
        <p>KEEP IT is the senior exhibition project from an Eastern Washington University BFA of Visual Communication Design Student. The goal of the project is to come up with solutions for prediciments that a designers encounter regarding sustainablity, social justice, and Morality.</p>

    <div class="problem section">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Like any career related to the sale/consumption of goods and ideas, designers will encounter situations that test their personal ethics.</p>
        
        <!--MAYBE DROPDOWN OF SOME SORT-->
        
        <h4>ie</h4>
        <ul>
	       <li>Most designed materials end up thrown away, or deprecated on the web</li>
	       <li>Many corporations don't take into account all social consequences</li>
	       <li>We don't always use our skills to promote a better human experience</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution section">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>These problems are broad and stretch across many disciplines. It's not realistic for one person to solve even one on a global level. The solution will come instead, from researching work that has been done already, updating it for a moddern audience, and contextualizing the findings for a wider audience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="company section">
        <h3>Research: In Good Company</h3>
        <p>There are many people; across many areas of study who have made advances in solving these problems. Any progress I make with my project is greatly in thanks to these giants:</p>

        <h3>Why Now?</h3>
        <h4>my rules</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Acknowledge your privilege
and position. Understand your limitations
philosophically, financially, and in
relation to deadlines. Recognize areas
for improvement</li>
            
            <li>Add value to extend the
lifespan of a design</li>
            
            <li>Whether working digitally or
in print, use responsible resources and
decision-making</li>
            
            <li>Use local materials, or even
better, re-use local materials</li>
            
            <li>Work pro-bono for a
non-profit, just cause, or local super
hero 4 hours a week.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With such a rich history of designers concerned with sustainability and social consciousness, how can I add to the discussion? I found my answer when I was looking at my own behaviours and how I can improve: I collect packaging that I like.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought this was something I needed to fix, like this collection was the remaining shrine to material design. But it's not; it's holding on to something with value that goes beyond its commercial lifespan; It's a butterfly collection.</p>

        <h3>Healing</h3>
        <p>For the final portion of my project I want to highlight people who are trying to make the workd a better place using techniques that echo the design principles I've gathered.</p>
        
        <h4>Standing Rock</h4>
        <p>Is KEEPING IT local by gathering together as a community to oppose the construction of the Dakota Access Pipline. Although supporters from around the country have come to help, the heart of the protest is a group of locals standing up for their community</p>
        
        <h4>The Black Lives Matter Movement</h4>
        <p>KEEP IT accessible by spreading news and support with the #blacklivesmatter hashtag. The hashtag is so accessible that it seemed to permeate every niche of American social life.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="goals section">
        <h3>So, What is my Solution?</h3>
        <p>When the project is complete it will be a series of physical pieces that highlight these guidelines for adding value in a sustainable way. The pieces may be made available to guests to take home and keep. The objects should cover a range of media. Finally, the final result will highlight social and environemental justice efforts which use these guidelines for something beyond graphic design. My hope is that everyone who sees it can walk away with something they want to keep and an idea of how to add value to the human experience. Thank you!</p>
